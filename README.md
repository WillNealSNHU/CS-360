Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address? - The goal of this app was to build a simple and functional inventory mobile application. That allowed for the addition and subtraction of quantity and the ability to add and remove various items. 
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful? - There was a need for a landing page, an inventory page and essentially an editing page. The app was streamline and fluid. 
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future? - I spent a lot of time reading over android Kotlin documentation, Stack Overflow, GitHub and asking my instructor (in some very special circumstances, where I could not find the answer myself). 
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal? - I spent a lot of time manually testing. 
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge? - I would say I really struggled with connecting up the database, I had never worked on a mobile app before this class, and while I have some full stack web experience connecting a database to a web app is slightly different. 
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience? - I would go back to that database. The reason I say this is because I had no idea what I was doing at first, I was able to read documentation, watch some YouTube videos, look at some stack overflow forums and implement what I had learned.
